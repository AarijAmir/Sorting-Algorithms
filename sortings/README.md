In Dart, I tackled a variety of sorting algorithms to enhance my programming skills. These included fundamental algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort, as well as more advanced ones like merge sort and quick sort, both of which utilize a divide-and-conquer approach in a recursive manner. I also delved into selection sort, shell sort, heap sort, and bucket sort, each offering unique strategies for efficiently arranging data. These sorting algorithms have equipped me with a diverse set of tools to optimize data organization and retrieval in different scenarios.
